# Clock Pulse Service
This software calls the [*Fastclock API*](https://github.com/tellurianinteractive/Tellurian.Trains.ModuleMeetingApp/wiki/API-Guidelines)
and creates logical pulses to drive analogue clocks with *positive* and *negative* voltages. 
This application just gives the information, it is up to hardware providers to translate the logical pulses to actual voltages for driving the clock.
